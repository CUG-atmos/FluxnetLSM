\usage{
get_default_conversion_options()
}
\value{
options list, with values:
\itemize{
\item \code{datasetname}:
Name of the dataset, e.g. FLUXNET2015 or La Thuile. Defaults to FLUXNET2015,
and thus must be set if processing a dataset not compliant with FLUXNET2015 format.
\item \code{datasetversion}: Version of the dataset, e.g. "1-3"
\item \code{flx2015_version}: Version of FLUXNET2015 data product being used, i.e. "FULLSET" or "SUBSET".
Required to set QC flags correctly.
\item \code{fair_use}: La Thuile Fair Use policy that data should comply with, e.g. "LaThuile" or "Fair_Use" (default).
Can be a single entry or a vector of several policies. If this is set, code will only extract
years that comply with the required policy/policies. Must provide fair_use_vec to use this
functionality.
\item \code{fair_use_vec}: A vector of Data Use policy for each year in the data file, e.g. "LaThuile" or "Fair_Use".
Should have years as vector column names.
\item \code{met_gapfill}: Method to use for gap-filling meteorological data. Set to one of
"ERAinterim", "statistical" or NA (default; no gap-filling).
\item \code{flux_gapfill}: Method to use for gap-filling flux data. Set to one of
"statistical" or NA (default; no gap-filling).
\item \code{missing}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be missing in any given year
\item \code{gapfill_met_tier1}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be gap-filled
(any quality) in any given year in Tier 1 met variables. Set to NA if not required.
\item \code{gapfill_met_tier2}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be gap-filled
(any quality) in any given year in Tier 2 met variables. Set to NA if not required.
\item \code{gapfill_flux}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be gap-filled
(any quality) in any given year in flux variables. Set to NA if not required.
\item \code{gapfill_good}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be good-quality gap-filled
in any given year. Refer to package documentation for information on QC flags.
Set to NA if not required (default).
\item \code{gapfill_med}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be medium-quality gap-filled
in any given year. Refer to package documentation for information on QC flags.
Set to NA if not required (default).
\item \code{gapfill_poor}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be poor-quality gap-filled
in any given year. Refer to package documentation for information on QC flags.
Set to NA if not required (default).
\item \code{gapfill_era}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be ERA-Interim gap-filled
in any given year. Refer to package documentation for information on QC flags.
Set to NA if not required (default).
\item \code{gapfill_stat}: Maximum percentage of time steps allowed to be statistically gap-filled
in any given year. Refer to package documentation for information on QC flags.
Set to NA if not required (default).
\item \code{min_yrs}: Minimum number of consecutive years to process
\item \code{linfill}: Maximum consecutive length of time (in hours) to be gap-filled
using linear interpolation. Used for all variables except rainfall. Defaults to 4 hours.
\item \code{copyfill}: Maximum consecutive length of time (in number of days) to be gap-filled using
copyfill. Defaults to 10 days.
\item \code{regfill}: Maximum consecutive length of time (in number of days) to be gap-filled
using multiple linear regression. Defaults to 30 days. Default method used to gapfill flux variables.
If gapfilling by copyfill is preferred, set regfill to NA.
\item \code{lwdown_method}: Method used to synthesize incoming longwave radiation.
One of "Abramowitz_2012" (default), "Swinbank_1963" or "Brutsaert_1975".
\item \code{check_range_action}: Action to take when input data falls outside of valid ranges
(as defined in data/Output_variables_*.csv).
One of "stop" (log error and stop processing, default),
"warn" (log error and continue), "ignore" (continue), or
"truncate" (set values outside the valid range to the range bounds).
\item \code{include_all_eval}: Should all evaluation values be included, regardless of data gaps?
If set to FALSE, any evaluation variables with missing or gap-filled values in
excess of the thresholds will be discarded.
\item \code{aggregate}: Time step (in hours) that the data is aggregated to. Must be divisible by 24 and can be set to
a maximum 24 hours (daily). Defaults to NA (no aggregation).
\item \code{model}: Name of land surface model. Used to retrieve model specific attributes, such as site
plant functional type.
\item \code{metadata_source}: Sources to check for metadata. One of 'all', 'csv', or 'web'.
\item \code{add_psurf}: La Thuile dataset does not include surface air pressure (PSurf). When set to TRUE,
it will be synthesised from air temperature and elevation.
